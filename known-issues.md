# Known Issues

This page documents known bugs, compatibility issues, and potential workarounds for Lumyn Labs products.

## Lumyn Studio

- **Issue**: Connecting to a device sometimes fails on the first try.
  - **Workaround**: Unplug and replug the device, then force-refresh Lumyn Studio (`Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`) and try connecting again.
- **Issue**: The "Modules" page does not yet allow editing of custom modules after they are created.
  - **Workaround**: You must delete and recreate the custom module to make changes. This will be fixed in a future update.
- **Issue**: The "New configuration detected, would you like to upload?" dialog in Studio can be overzealous and may appear even when configurations are identical.
  - **Workaround**: You can safely dismiss the dialog if you're confident the configurations match. This will be improved in a future update.
