# Lumyn Labs Documentation
Welcome to the documentation website for Lumyn Labs products!

# Who We Are
Lumyn Labs was founded to help makers push the boundaries of what they can achieve. We're still small (just two FRC alumni), but we're focused on creating products that raise the floor, allowing you to do more for less.
