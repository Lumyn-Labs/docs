## FRC Team Number

The **FRC Team Number** setting allows you to set the team number for your FRC team. It must be a valid FRC team number (a whole number between 1 and 99999). This setting is used in the device configuration but is optional.

## Cache

Lumyn Studio caches items from the CDN to improve load times, such as module images and other assets. This setting allows you to clear the cache if you're experiencing issues with the studio.
